* The first block is basic, which will be about 10 bucks a month, which will give the user some basic features such as 5 avatars, 2 languages they can learn (of their choosing), and regular priority email & live chat support
* The next block is Standard will have to be quite a bit more expensive but also will have all the features, access to all avatars and languages, priority email support, and chat support
* The next block is Commercial which will include everything that the Standard plan gives but could be used by multiple users at once via multi-user migration
* Price will be decided on a case by case basis 


Reviews:

* Thought about having it at the bottom of the product features page, but there might be a better place for it somewhere else (currently omitted from the website but may come back)

NOTE: As of October 24th, 2021 the home page is not responsive on Google Chrome (the image is shortened), but works properly on Safari. This is currently being investigated.
